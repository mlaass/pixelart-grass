# Dynamic 2D Grass

A stylised 2D pixel-art grass system for Godot 4.5+, featuring wind animation, character-reactive displacement, grass destruction via effector decals, and world-space cloud shadows.

Created by **Jomoho Games**, based on original work by [Dylearn](https://github.com/Dylearn).

---

## Features

- Camera-adaptive grass streaming (handles large tilemaps efficiently)
- Per-instance wind sway via dual scrolling noise textures
- Stepped framerate animation with per-blade phase offset
- Fake perspective UV squishing
- Noise-based colour patches and accent grass variants
- Character-reactive displacement via effector system
- Grass destruction and regrowth via effector decals
- Full-scene cloud shadow overlay with pseudo-3D offset
- TileMapLayer integration with automatic grass placement
- All parameters exposed as `@export` properties in the inspector

## Quick Start

### 1. Set up your TileMapLayer

Create a `TileMapLayer` node with your ground tiles. The grass system reads this to decide where grass grows.

**Add a custom data layer to mark grass tiles:**

1. Select your TileSet resource
2. Go to **Custom Data Layers** in the TileSet inspector
3. Add a layer named `is_grass` with type **bool**
4. Open the **TileSet** editor, select tiles that should have grass
5. In each tile's **Custom Data** panel, set `is_grass = true`

Only tiles marked with `is_grass = true` will generate grass blades.

**Add a navigation polygon layer (optional):**

For per-tile grass coverage shapes (e.g. sloped edges, partial coverage), you can use navigation polygons to define the exact grass boundary:

1. Add a **Navigation Layer** to your TileSet
2. Draw navigation polygons on individual tiles in the TileSet editor — these define the area where grass can grow within that tile
3. Set the `grass_nav_layer` export on both `GrassChunkManager2D` and `GrassEffectManager2D` to match the navigation layer index you used

If no navigation polygon is set on a tile, the full tile area is used.

### 2. Add GrassChunkManager2D

Add a `GrassChunkManager2D` node (from `addons/dynamic_2d_grass/scripts/GrassChunkManager2D.gd`) to your scene and configure:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `tile_map` | Reference to your TileMapLayer (auto-detected if a child named "TileMapLayer" exists) |
| `density` | Grass blades per tile (default: 6) |
| `grass_sprite_size` | Size of each grass blade in pixels |
| `grass_material` | Assign the included `grass_2d_material.tres` |
| `grass_texture` | Sprite atlas for grass blades |
| `grass_nav_layer` | Navigation layer index for per-tile coverage shapes (default: 0) |

### 3. Add GrassEffectManager2D

Add a `GrassEffectManager2D` node and configure:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `chunk_manager` | Reference to your GrassChunkManager2D |
| `camera` | Reference to your Camera2D |
| `viewport_scale` | Resolution scale for the terrain data texture |
| `grass_nav_layer` | Must match the value set on GrassChunkManager2D |

### 4. Add effectors

To make objects interact with grass, add `GrassEffector2D` as a child of any Node2D:

- Set a texture for the effect shape
- Choose `target_channel`: R (displacement), G (coverage), B (cloud Y-offset), A (cloud immunity)
- Choose `blend_operation`: ADD (accumulate) or SUB (erase)

### 5. Add cloud shadows (optional)

Add a `CanvasLayer` with a `ColorRect` child. Attach `CloudOverlay2D.gd` to the ColorRect and assign:
- The included `cloud_overlay_material.tres` as the material
- References to your camera and effect manager

## Example Scene

An example scene is included in `example/scenes/Demo2D.tscn`. Open it to see the full system in action with a tilemap, grass, effectors, bombs, and cloud shadows.

The `example/` directory is optional and can be safely deleted without affecting the addon.
